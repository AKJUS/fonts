summary: "Duployan shorthand (Sloan-Duployan shorthand, Duployan stenography) is an American alphabet, written left-to-right. Geometric stenography script created in 1860 by Father Émile Duployé for writing French, later expanded and adapted for writing English, German, Spanish, Romanian, and Chinook Jargon. Heavily cursive (connected), allows words to be written in a single stroke. Praised for simplicity and speed of writing. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping)."
