<p>KH Type is a type foundry founded by Kurppa Hosk. We offer retail and bespoke typefaces along with other typography-related expertise, like wordmark refinements and art direction. Typography has always been intrinsically linked to the core of Kurppa Hoskâ€™s work, and with KH Type we aim to celebrate our typographic heritage by making our independently designed typefaces available to license.</p>
