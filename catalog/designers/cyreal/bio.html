    Cyreal is a foundry deeply rooted in the open-source movement. Founded in 2010, the collective has expanded popular typefaces like Nunito, Rubik, and Raleway with Cyrillic support, among other works. Its original releases, including Lora, Prata, and Alice, have become a quiet staple in digital and print design, widely appearing across websites, apps, and editorial layouts.
