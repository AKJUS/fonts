Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.
In their first letter to shareholders, our founders highlighted Google’s goal to “develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.”
This vision continues to guide all of us at Google.
We believe in technology’s power and potential to have a profoundly positive impact across the world.
