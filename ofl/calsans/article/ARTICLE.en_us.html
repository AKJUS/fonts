<p>Cal Sans is a geometric sans-serif tuned for display, that is, large point sizes. It is an Open Source typeface to adorn the headlines and interfaces of Cal.com, a company founded by Peer Richelsen and Bailey Pumfleet and interface design by Ciarán Hanrahan.</p>

<p>The basis of Cal Sans is my initial answer to what my Futura would be. It fit well with Peer’s brief, for something serious and and geometric so that the letters of “cal.com” would have circular shapes throughout. It was decided early on that it be open source for all!</p>
