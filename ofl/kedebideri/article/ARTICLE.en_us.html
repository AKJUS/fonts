<p>The Beria Erfe script is built around a sampling of the traditional animal brands seen on livestock, rocks of the desert, and in caves of North Darfur and eastern Chad. The script was first introduced by a school teacher named Adam Tajir, and it was further developed by Siddick Adam Issa. The script is now encoded in Unicode 17.0.</p>

<p>The font name, Kedebideri, means "Let's write!" in the Zaghawa Beria language.</p>
