    Playpen Sans Hebrew was designed by TypeTogether after over two years of primary research into handwriting education for Latin-based languages, available at <a href="https://primarium.info">primarium.info</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to ExtraBold (800). It supports two different writing systems: Hebrew and Latin, covering four Hebrew languages and over 332 Latin-based ones, along with a set of ‚Äúreward icons‚Äù as emoji. 
    The Playpen Sans superfamily also includes a Pan-African Latin, Greek, Cyrllic (Playpen Sans), Arabic (Playpen Sans Arabic), Devanagari (Playpen Sans Deva), and Thai (PlaypenSans Thai) fonts that expand the language support of the system.
</p>
<p>
    Playpen Sans Hebrew has alternate glyphs for each character that are automatically applied as you type, with a built-in shuffler that both ensures variety and avoids repetition. This adds to the overall organic, spontaneous, and authentic feel of the handwritten style.

<h3>A casual handwriting font</h3>
<p>
    Some typefaces excel at just one thing, while others do multiple things well. Playpen Sans stands out by perfectly imitating casual handwriting, blending the organic feel of something made by hand with the precision of a professional digital typeface. Handwritten text is naturally inconsistent, but digital fonts aim for uniformity. Playpen Sans bridges this gap by offering a set of characters that are ‚Äúthe same, but different,‚Äù creating an authentic and human-like appearance within the constraints of digital design. It has a set of clear letterforms that are easy to write and recognize. The design forms a bridge between handwritten and typographic letters, friendly to both little readers and adults.

<p>
    To achieve this, Playpen Sans includes multiple versions of each character and a built-in shuffler, ensuring no two shapes repeat too closely. This results in text that feels spontaneous, fun, and organic, while maintaining the functionality of a modern typeface. Designed with non-designers in mind, it shines in informal settings like greeting cards, invitations, children‚Äôs books, and graphic novels. Its clarifying features, such as straight and curved endings for certain letters and optional shapes, add to its versatility.
</p>
<p>
    Playpen Sans combines the best of both worlds: the aesthetic charm of handwritten text and the technological capabilities of a digital font. It‚Äôs spontaneous, authentic, and effortlessly bridges the gap between the organic and the digital.
