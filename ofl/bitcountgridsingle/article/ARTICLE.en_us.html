<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minumum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the mininum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary is articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparant colors.</p>

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>
